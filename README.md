üåü Why I Created This?
My reason for creating this is to have fun while experimenting with CSS animations to make web design a little more elegant. It was inspired by the organic feel of flowers and taking that into a website where the blossoming of a flower could be smooth and fluid.

This project has been used for several purposes:

Learning CSS Animations: I wanted to know more about CSS animations and practice keyframe, transition, and timing functions. Decoration of Web Pages: This project may serve as a decorative title for various websites or web applications and would add an elegant effect to them. It is a chance to be creative in combining visual appeal with coding by pulling together minor bits of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS into one cohesive animation.
Addition to Portfolio: It truly showcases my front-end skills, and it will be a part of my portfolio to demonstrate design and animation capabilities.
This project has taught me a lot, and I hope other people can learn from or get inspiration for this project, either to improve their current Web designs or play around with CSS animations.
